Evaluate a trained model
========================================

.. _get_results:


After training a model or obtaining a trained model, we can readily get our model to be used for forward pass. For this matter, we provide a script to get the results for a trained model.
We provide an example brain segmentation model for LPBA40 dataset in the following link:

Our split can be found here (absolute paths needs to be fixed):

.. code:: shell

        Arguments:
            -m : the path to model file, 
            -o  : the directory you want to have the uploads at.
            -i: absolute path to image
            -l: absolute path to label
            -ts : setting file for the evaluation
            -txt:  
            

This script outputs the 3D segmentation to `{-o}/seg/res/records/3D`, under the name of {image_name}_test_iter_0_output.nii.gz.

An example arguments could be as following:

.. code:: shell

    python eval_seg.py -m MODEL_PATH -o outputs -i s22.nii.gz -l s22.nii.gz -ts settings_for_lpba/seg_test/

    OR 
    python eval_seg.py -m MODEL_PATH -o outputs -txt outputs/25case/test/file_path_list.txt -ts settings_for_lpba/seg_test/
